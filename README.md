  Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is a discipline which is widely used to satisfy business needs to predict accurately the future   values of continuous variables which vary overtime.
  Traditionally, the forecasting techniques rely on the venerable ARIMA model for decades but recent studies are pushing hard     on more modern techniques including specific Deep learning architectures and ad-hoc approach like the Prophet by Facebook.
